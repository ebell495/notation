Thanks for trying /Fun Notation/, it's a highly experimental musical notation system, at the top of this page, there are a bunch of topics to browse, you may also check the [Web Site](https://www.notation.fun) for more information.

We are using [Solf√®ge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solf%C3%A8ge) system for the note names, so instead of *C D E F G A B*, they are named *Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti*, or *1 2 3 4 5 6 7*, it's a relative notation, means the actual pitch of each notes are decided by key, check the notes page for note pitches in this songs.

# Notes
Each note has a color associated with, which is for quick recognition. The color choice is based on [Chromesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromesthesia), check the colors page for more details.

# Chords
We use circles with slots in them to represent chords, it's quite controversial, so need some more explanation.

# Guitar
Many features of /Fun Notation/ are created for my needs for guitar tabs.
